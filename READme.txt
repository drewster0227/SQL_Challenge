I think I extraced the proper data for the sql files however I found this module to be quite challenging so if there's a mistake let me know and I'll attempt to fix it. I used prior in class examples to build most of my code combined with chat gpt for the tons of syntax errors I kept getting. My tables were not created in the proper order as I copy pasted from my quick data base as the skeleton of my code.
